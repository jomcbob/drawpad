a repo where i am going to make a sort of etch-a-sketch



overall I like it you can see it live at https://jomcbob.github.io/drawpad 

there is a small bug where the fadeaway button gets rid of the border on 
each of the cells you pass over while its active if you know how to fix it 
please give a pull request
